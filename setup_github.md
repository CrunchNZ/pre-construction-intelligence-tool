# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `pre-construction-intelligence-tool`
5. Description: `AI-powered platform that analyzes historical project data to inform tenders, estimates, and procurement decisions for construction firms`
6. Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Add Remote Origin

Once you've created the repository, GitHub will show you the commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pre-construction-intelligence-tool.git

# Push the main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Push

After pushing, you should see all 76 files uploaded to GitHub. You can verify by:
1. Refreshing your GitHub repository page
2. Running `git status` to confirm everything is up to date

## Step 4: Future Updates

For future updates, use:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

## Repository Structure

Your repository will contain:
- **Backend**: Django application with AI models, analytics, and integrations
- **Frontend**: React application with Material-UI and Redux
- **Docker**: Complete containerization setup
- **Documentation**: README, workflow tracking, and setup guides
- **Configuration**: Environment templates and deployment configs
